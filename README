The programme at hand is a classical Molecular dynamics programme 
simulating a system of Argon atoms.

The following files are used for:

main.py     -> specifying the system (such as time-step etc.)
physics.py  -> Here, the physics are implemented; such as the start conditions
               availible and functions that can be used.
movie.gp    -> gnuplot-file that uses the output to animate the simulation under study
               in a 3d-plot of moving particles
velocitiy.gp-> gnuplot-file that uses the output to plot the (time-dependent) velocity
               distribution (as animation)
pairdist.gp -> gnuplot-file that uses an other output-file to animate the pair density
movie2.gp   -> makes 2 other animations of the system. Compared to movie.gp, here colour
               is used to indicate (a) the height of atoms or (b) the speed of individual
               atoms. With this, special cases can be made easier to understand


Units:
time : ps
length: Angstrom
Energy: Angstrom^2*kg/ps^2=10^4 J
velocity: Angstrom/ps=10^2m/s
